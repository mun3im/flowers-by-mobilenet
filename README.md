# Flowers by MobileNet

Tutorial on using MobileNet with flowers dataset.

Original idea: [https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/audio/simple_audio](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/audio/simple_audio)

I changed the dataset from Google mini speech dataset to flowers to make the tutorial even shorter.

Dataset homepage is [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/tf_flowers)
